Lexery
======

Lexery is all about lexical trickery, transforming words into new words.
This was actually a Christmas present for my mother.

Playing
-------

Each round starts with a random word.
To make you new word, you can:

* Add a letter
* Remove a letter
* Replace a letter
* Swap two letters

You may never reuse a word, and you are allowed a limited number of 
'imaginary' as long as you make them using one of the moves listed above.

That's it.  Try to make as many words as you can from the given word.

Examples
--------

Turn Grass into Salt:

      grass => glass => lass => last => salt

Find your Dinner:

      find => fine => dine => diner => dinner
      
Hackery Details
---------------
Lexery uses Gosu for its game interface.  This is my second game 
built on Gosu, and I think it might be possible to extract a fair amount of 
the code into a small game framework.

See 'wordlists/' for more information on the wordlist Lexery uses.
