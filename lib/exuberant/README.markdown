Exuberant
---------
Exuberant is a lazy extraction of the framework code used to make a few of my 
games.  Some code that should be in Exuberant still lives in Lexery, over time
that should be fixed.

The most interesting parts are probably the transition effects defined in 
`transition.rb` and perhaps the widgets, though they're very basic. The event
code in `timer.rb` and `publisher.rb` might be of interest as well.

This code is not very coherent yet, and it has mostly just come together out of
necessity, over time it may get better.

Enjoy,
